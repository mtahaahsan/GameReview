This is a video game review website made using linux terminal and atom/visual studio
Everything should be working, but I am not sure if the categories table will be populated
as I manually entered those values into the categories table

In the event that the categories aren't there, you will need to open the rails console
and manually enter them in this order

[#<Category id: 1, name: "RPG"">, 
#<Category id: 2, name: "Racing">, 
#<Category id: 3, name: "Action">, 
#<Category id: 4, name: "Action-Adventure">, 
#<Category id: 5, name: "Puzzle", ">, 
#<Category id: 6, name: "First Person Shooter">]

In the event you want to edit something already made from a user, here are the list of users users

I'm sorry, I didn't know you'd be using those emails
